# Case-Study-5_Breast_Cancer_Analysis

## Breast Cancer Dataset:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 million people in 2015. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumour that can often be seen on an X-ray or felt as a lump.
Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survivor. The key challenges against its detection are how to classify tumours into malignant (Cancer) or benign (not cancer). A tumour is considered malignant (Cancer) if the cells can grow into surrounding tissues or spread to distant areas of the body. A benign tumour does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body the way cancer can. But benign tumours can be serious if they press on vital structures such as blood vessel or nerves.
Machine Learning technique can dramatically improve the level of diagnosis in breast cancer. Research shows that experience physicians can detect cancer by 79% accuracy, while 91% (up to 97%) accuracy can be achieved using Machine Learning techniques.
## Project Task
In this study, my task is to classify tumours into malignant (cancer) or benign using features obtained from several cell images.
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
